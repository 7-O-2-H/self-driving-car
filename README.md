# Javasctipt Self Driving Car

This application was built to explore neural networks. By using a 2 model of a roadway and adding additional cars as obstacles, users are able to train the network by selecting the best randomly generated results.

## Features/Usage

- Generate a preset number of AI guided cars
  - You can edit this number N in main.js (line 11)
  - The most successful result will be highlighted in blue
- Select save to store the most successful result and refresh to generate a new sample of N test cars based on the initial successful rate
- Repeat until you have a successful network model and rudimentary self-driving car
- Create other test scenarios by changing the existing obstacle cars "traffic" in main.js (line 24)
- A visual representation of the neural network is visible and updates which neurons are firing in real time based on the best test car
